# Bell-State-Quantum-Entanglement
# 🌌 Quantum Entanglement – Bell State Circuit

This project demonstrates quantum entanglement by creating a Bell state using two qubits.

---

## 🧠 Concept

A Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate entangles two qubits such that their measurement outcomes are perfectly correlated.

---

## ⚙️ Circuit Description

1. Applied Hadamard gate on q0
2. Applied CNOT gate (q0 → q1)
3. Measured both qubits
4. Observed correlated outputs (00 and 11)
